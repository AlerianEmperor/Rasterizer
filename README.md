# C-Rasterizer
Rasterizer in C++ to study how Graphics Driver work without third party library. The result is simillar to images rendered by OpenGL or Vulkan!

# Features

- Rasterize line and Triangle.
- Graphics Pipeline.
- Perspective Projection.
- Camera Movement. 
- Texture Mapping.
- Gourad Shading.
- Shadow mapping with perspective inverse.
  
# To Do

- Normal Mapping.
- Shadow Mapping.
- PBR.

shadow mapping with perspective inverse and orthographic, more general than tiny renderer, finally! some thing to update in 2025, next will be skeleton animation with shadow
